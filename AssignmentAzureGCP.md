# _*4) My Key Takeaways from this Assignment*_

## _*â€¢ Azure and GCP*_
### ðŸ“Œ It allows me to explore cost analysis (dashboards).

### ðŸ“Œ It gives recommendations depending on my budget spending.
### ðŸ“Œ I find it easy to explore and access as a beginner.
### ðŸ“Œ To me, both GCP and Azure are almost the same. Personally, I find Microsoft Azure visually pleasing. Its aesthetics are easy to understand and use. Maybe for others it doesn't matter, but it matters to me if I will be using it long term.
